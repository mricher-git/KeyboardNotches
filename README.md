# Keyboard Notches

This mod makes it so that the initial keypress for Throttle, Brake and Independent Brake provide one "notch" of input on the respective control. This works for the locomotive as well as the remote controller.

This is particularly useful with the Airbrake and Realism Overhaul mods by Zeibach. 

In the case of airbrakes for example, a single tap of F3/F4 will move the brake lever between Release/Lap/Service/Emergency. You no longer have to time your taps to get the lever to move exactly one notch. Same goes for independent brake. When using the remote control is becomes very tedious and hard to see what the levers are doing, so this ensures you know exactly what position it's in.

Pressing and holding any of the key commands for more than 200ms reverts to default behavior so you can still quickly ramp-up and own your throttle and independent brake for example.
